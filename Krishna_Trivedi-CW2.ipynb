    "\n",
    "This project is an in-depth analysis of Impact of Music therapy on Mental Health. The hypothesis for this study is that employees presenting to directors of public health and mental health coordinators aim to provide actionable insights to influence policy and improve mental health interventions. This project presents an evidence-based, user-friendly tool in the form of an interactive dashboard.  \n",
    "The dashboard facilitates effective decision-making by offering visualizations that reveal the effects of music therapy on anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. The dashboard allows users to click through and discover insights that are important, such as app usage by the type of music preferred, demographic differences, and average hours of music listened to daily. The data-driven policy will ensure that reforms are based on solid data and consistent with the mission of improving mental health outcomes. "

    "#Project Background \n",
    "\n",
    "As mental health becomes a growing priority in public health policy, interest is growing in non-pharmaceutical interventions such as music therapy. This project is in part a response to this interest by examining the accessibility and effectiveness of music therapy and how it may increase mental health in a low-cost manner. The analysis employs survey data and concentrates on the identified Palmer factors - age, music genre, and music use behaviour, which are key demographic and behavioural factors influencing mental health outcomes. These factors were identified in prior research and form the foundation of this study’s analytical framework. \n",
    "The project is designed to assist policymakers, mental health directors, and program coordinators in making informed decisions about mental health interventions. The dashboard provides clarity on key areas where music therapy has the most impact, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. This insight empowers decision-makers to introduce new music-based policies or refine existing initiatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key metrics that matter: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Time spent using music each day and relationships to anxiety, depression, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Guideline specific to music genres and their impact on mental health helping to build interventions based on music genres. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mental health responses to music therapy differ by age group, allowing to modify policies accordingly. "

    "#Background to the Project \n",
    "\n",
    "The Impact of Music Therapy on Mental Health project is in response to the increasing demand for non-pharmaceutical interventions for mental health. According to WHO (2022), there exist steadily increasing cases of anxiety, depression and insomnia, just to name a few mental diseases, which in turn leads to the need for additional treatment methods to supplement conventional ones. Music therapy matches this need quite well by providing therapy-oriented musical experiences associated with effective improvisations and didactic practices that promote emotional regulation, reduce anxiety, and improve cognitive well-being (Koelsch, 2010). \n",
    "This project aims to support directors of public health and mental health program coordinators by providing a data-driven interactive dashboard that visualizes the role of music therapy in improving mental health. The dashboard does provide critical insight into how certain aspects — the music genre, how long a track is listened to, and the demographic differences across age groups — affect mental health outcomes, as data cleaning is performed to remove inconsistencies and ensure data quality, indicated by visual status markers. Latent class and within patient heterogeneity reflect broader trends, they can help policy makers to make evidence-based adjustments to policy and designs of tailored interventions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis, which is based on survey data, includes and reflects respondents’ habits related to the consumption of music along with their mental health status. They will focus on the following areas: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Differences by Age: (e.g., 19-25, 26-35): How various age groups respond to music therapy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Research Music genres influence on anxiety, depression and insomnia. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Leverage of Daily Music: Explore the impact of listening to music daily in aiding mental wellness, with recommendations on appropriate session lengths for maximizing benefit. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project utilizes Python, Pandas, Plotly and Dash to combine contemporary data analytics and visualization techniques into building an accessible, interactive and hierarchical dashboard. Tufte liveried its guidelines for simplicity, clarity and effectiveness of data presentation (Tufte, 2001), which inspire visual design principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives of the Project: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Evidence-Based Policy Recommendations: Provide tangible evidence for the effects of music therapy on anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Interactive Exploration: Provide a dashboard that enables filtering by age, genre, and music usage to support tailored policy recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Evidence Based Policymaking: Help public health directors and mental health program coordinators formulate policies that fit better with mental health needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Given the mental health burden worldwide (World Health Organization, 2022), it is important to note that our decision to focus on music therapy is highly consistent with Global Health priorities as this type of intervention is low-cost and highly scalable globally. This project therefore fills an important gap, enabling policymakers to make evidence-informed decisions which promote better mental health outcomes at scale. "

    "#Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "The Impact of Music Therapy on Mental Health project highlights the role of data-driven decision-making in public health. Using the MXMH Survey Results dataset, the project identified key insights on how music therapy influences mental health outcomes like anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD. The interactive dashboard supports evidence-based interventions by enabling exploration by age, genre, and usage. \n",
    "Key findings include the benefits of music therapy for the 19-25 age group and the ideal usage of 1-3 hours per day for better mental health outcomes. These insights can help shape personalized mental health strategies and justify the cost-effectiveness of music therapy compared to other interventions. The process of cleaning, analysing, and visualising the data strengthened key technical skills and demonstrated how interactive dashboards can inform policy development and mental health program design. This project serves as a model for how analytics can drive meaningful, data-driven change in public health. \n",
    "Based on the insights from this project, public health authorities should consider implementing a Personalized Music Therapy Initiative. This policy would focus on delivering targeted music therapy programs tailored to specific age groups, especially individuals aged 19-25. The initiative would recommend daily music therapy sessions lasting 1-3 hours, which have been shown to yield significant mental health improvements. The program could be rolled out in schools, universities, and community centres, offering free or subsidized access to curated music therapy sessions. By leveraging these insights, policymakers can create an evidence-based, cost-effective solution for mental health support that prioritizes at-risk demographics. "
